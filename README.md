A Garry's Mod gamemode where you have to kill the rake. The rake is very fast, and has a lot of health. So it's not smart to go alone, however, if you can kill it, you are rewarded as being
the top soldier in your country.

The rake is fast and stronger than you might think, to fight it you need to be predicted, and articulated.

## How to play

For each version, it is recommended to stay up to date on the [Requirement Collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3292769727)

### v0.0.1 (current)

To play the actual game, you need to have a NavMesh in your map. 
This means that the map owner, or you, have to build one.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Nodes are also required if you have `rake_UseForTracking` set to `ainodes`

The DrGBase RAKE requires a navmesh in order to be able to walk 
around and find you. Or your friends. However, a navmesh is *NOT* 
required to spawn loot or the rake in the map.

Both are recommended, as AI Nodes have less chances of getting the rake stuck when being spawned.
But to configure this, use `rake_UseForTracking`.

<hr>

To start the game, type in `rake_StartGame` into the console or use the `E` key. (or whichever key you have binded to `USE`)

> üìù To end the match early, please use `rake_EndMatch`. do note in 
> this version players are not allowed to join mid-game.
